Probablistic Graphical Models representation in Python

Probablistic Graphical Models (PGMs) use a graph-based representation
to compactly encode the joint distribution. PGMs use elements of 
graph theory and probability theory. There are two classes of PGMs. 
directed acyclic graphical models are called Bayesian Networks (BNs)
and undirected graphical models are Markov networks.

The code in this repository is based off the Matlab code
from Daphne Koller's Coursera class on PGMs <https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm> For the assignments in the class students were given starter  Matlab code
and had to implement various algorithms, etc.

While I grew to like Matlab, I needed to implement the inference and represenation of PGMs in Python for a personal project of mine. So I went down the 
rabbit hole. The code here depends on NumPy and uses Python v2.7.
